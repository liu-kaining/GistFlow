Input: Raw email content (Markdown format).
Output: A valid JSON object strictly following the `Gist` schema.

Rules:
1. **Filtering**: If the email is a receipt, pure marketing spam, verification code, or extremely low value, set `is_spam_or_irrelevant` to true.
2. **Scoring**: Score from 0-100.
   - >80: High density technical deep dives, tutorials, breaking news.
   - 40-60: General updates, weekly links without context.
   - <30: Marketing fluff.
3. **Language**: Summarize and extract insights in **Chinese (Simplified)**, unless the content is strictly code or proper nouns.
4. **Formatting**: Keep `key_insights` concise (bullet points style, 3-5 items max).
5. **Tags**: Extract 2-5 relevant category tags (e.g., AI, Dev, Finance, Product, Career).
6. **Links**: Extract any mentioned tools, GitHub repos, articles, or resources.

Remember: Output MUST be a valid JSON object matching the schema exactly.
